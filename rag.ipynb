Let us provide some examples to illustrate how to use the above definition for solving simple problems. Example 4 Consider that a coin is tossed twice. What is the probability that at least one of the out comes is a a head. We have already discussed above what the sample space of such a random experiment is. If we denote by A the event that at least one of the coins turn up heads then A = {HH, TH, HT} Thus we have P(A) = 3 4 Note that each of the four possible events in this case are equally likely with probability 1 4. The reader can devise more such events and try to figure out the probability using the classical approach. □ Let us now through the following theorem the following facts. Theorem 1 Let Ωbe a sample space associated with a random experiment and let the sample space consists only of a finite number of elementary events. Then we have the following. i) For any event A we have 0 ≤P(A) ≤1 ii) P(Ω) = 1 and P(∅) = 0. iii) For any two events A and B associated with the random experiment we have P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B). Further if A and B are mutually exclusive i.e. AcapB = ∅then we have P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B). iv) Let Ac denote the complement of the event A. Thus the occurrence of Ac is equivalent to the non-occurrence of A. Further we have P(Ac) = 1 −P(A). Proof : Let us assume that there are N elementary events. By noting that 0 ≤ nA ≤N, it is clear that by dividing all the sides by N we obtain 0 ≤P(A) ≤1. This proves i). Further as nΩ= N, it is clear that P(Ω) = 1 and of course n∅= 0, which proves that P(∅) = 0. This completes the proof of ii). In order to prove iii) we must first define the events A ∪B and A ∩B.

       "  'text': '3 The Theorem of Reverend Thomas Bayes Thomas Bayes was a priest, an English priest. He the theorem that now bears his name, was published after his notes were edited by Robert Price. Thomas Bayes had not published his result. The idea of Bayes later led to the field of Bayesian statistics which has huge applications in modern medicine and machine learning; for example. Theorem 2 Let us consider the probability space (Ω, F, P). Let {B1, . . . , Bn} be a finite sequence of events such that P(Bi) > 0, ∀i = 1, . . . , n and Ω= Sn i=1 Bi. Let A ∈F such that P(A) > 0, then P(Bi|A) = P(Bi ∩A) P(A) and this can be written equivalently as P(Bi|A) = P(Bi)P(A|Bi) Pn j=1 P(Bj)P(A|Bj) Proof : Now we shall provide the simple proof. Observe that P(Bi|A) = P(Bi ∩A) P(A) Also note that P(A ∩Bi) = P(Bi)P(A|Bi) while by the theorem of total probability P(A) = n X i=1 P(Bi)P(A|Bi) The result thus follows in an obvious way. □ We would also like to note here that, this theorem also holds for n = ∞. A more simple version of the Bayes Theorem can be provided with two events A, B ∈F with P(A) > 0, P(B) > 0. Note that if B ∈F =⇒Bc ∈F and we know that Ω= B ∪Bc. Therefore, P(A) = P(A ∩B) + P(A ∩Bc) = P(B)P(A|B) + P(Bc)P(A|Bc) Therefore, P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B) P(B)P(A|B) + P(Bc)P(A|Bc) One may at this point as what is the meaning of the Bayes theorem. What does it tell us. It tells us that if we know the probability of an event to begin with, B 4 '},\n",

Polya’s Urn problem revisited: We are given two urns, namely Urn 1 and Urn 2. In Urn 1, we have two white and three blue balls. While in Urn 2, we have three white and four blue balls. A ball is drawn at random from Urn 1 and put into Urn 2. Then from Urn 2 we draw a ball at random again. What is the probability that it is blue? 4.

In the simple cases where Ωis finite or countable, we have ˆΩ= Range X where ˆΩis the new sample space on which we will work on. Let us now take another example with success and failure as outcomes for which similar questions as above can be asked. Instead of tossing a coin if roll a die and if we see an even number you get rupee one and if it is an odd number you get give me rupee 1, i.e. you get rupee -1. Thus we are again interested in computing P(X = 1) and P(X = −1) though the random experiments are very different in a physical sense. Moving ahead if we consider an uncountable sample space then it might not be so easy to talk about a random variable. So now we shall consider the scenario where the whole R may be considered as a sample space. If that is so, what subsets of R should be considered as events. A reasonable thing to consider is a Borel subset of R. We have discussed the issue of Borel sets in Chapter 1. So here we shall be concerned with pair (R, B), where B is the Borel σ-algebra on R. Now we define the notion of a random variable. Definition 1 Let (Ω, F, P) be a probability space and let (R, B) be the real line along with the Borel σ-algebra. Then X : Ω−→R is called a random variable if X−1(B) ∈F for each B ∈B. The above property of the random variable is called measurability of the function X. In fact to be precise X is often called a measurable function. Note that X−1(B) = {ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ∈B}. Thus X is a random variable if and only if the set {ω : X(ω) ∈B} ∈F. This means that, if B is an event in R, then its inverse image X−1(B) must be an event in Ω. This correspondence is what makes the notion of a random variable meaningful and allows us to define a probability measure on (R, B). A probability measure on (R, B) is usually defined as ν : B −→[0, 1] as ν(B) = P(X−1(B)) = P({ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ∈B}). It is clear that ν(B) ∈[0, 1], for any B ∈B a property that it inherits from P. Now consider ν(R) = P(X−1(R)) = P({ω ∈Ω: X(ω) ∈R}). 2 ',\n",

      "Sample chunks: However, in real practice, it turns out to be very useful. Let us provide some examples to illustrate how to use the above definition for solving simple problems. Example 4 Consider that a coin is tossed twice. What is the probability that at least one of the out comes is a a head. We have already discussed above what the sample space of such a random experiment is. If we denote by A the event that at least one of the coins turn up heads then A = {HH, TH, HT} Thus we have P(A) = 3 4 Note that each of the four possible events in this case are equally likely with probability 1 4. The reader can devise more such events and try to figure out the probability using the classical approach. □ Let us now through the following theorem the following facts. Theorem 1 Let Ωbe a sample space associated with a random experiment and let the sample space consists only of a finite number of elementary events. Then we have the following. i) For any event A we have 0 ≤P(A) ≤1 ii) P(Ω) = 1 and P(∅) = 0. iii) For any two events A and B associated with the random experiment we have P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B). Further if A and B are mutually exclusive i.e. AcapB = ∅then we have P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B). iv) Let Ac denote the complement of the event A. Thus the occurrence of Ac is equivalent to the non-occurrence of A. Further we have P(Ac) = 1 −P(A). Proof : Let us assume that there are N elementary events. By noting that 0 ≤ nA ≤N, it is clear that by dividing all the sides by N we obtain 0 ≤P(A) ≤1. This proves i). Further as nΩ= N, it is clear that P(Ω) = 1 and of course n∅= 0, which proves that P(∅) = 0. This completes the proof of ii). In order to prove iii) we must first define the events A ∪B and A ∩B. The event A ∪B 4 means that an if an elementary event is realized which ie either in A or B or both then we will say that the event A∪B has occurred. We leave the definition of the event A ∩B to the reader. More formally we have A ∪B = {ω ∈Ω: ω ∈A, or ω ∈B or both} and A ∩B = {ω ∈Ω: ω ∈A, ω ∈B}. It will be important to note that when we count the number of elements of A and B we count the number of elements in A ∩B twice and thus nA∪B = nA + nB −nA∩B. Dividing both sides by N we obtain, P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∩B). if A ∩B = ∅using ii) we can see that P(A ∩B) = 0. Thus P(A ∪B) = P(A) + P(B). This property will be a building block in devising a formal theory of probability where we do not have to worry about the issue of equally likely events and that made the classical definition circular in nature. For the last assertion i.e. iv) let us begin by defining the event Ac, the comple- ment of A which simply means the non-occurence of A, i.e. Ac = {ω ∈Ω: ω ̸∈A}. This simple means that nAc = N −nA. This shows that P(Ac) = N −nA N = 1 −nA N . This shows that P(Ac) = 1 −P(A). This completes the proof. □ We can now use this theorem to deduce some more relationships regarding probabilities of the events A and B. Observe that if A ⊆B, then nA ≤nB and dividing both sides by N we conclude that P(A) ≤P(B). One the other hand observe that from Theorem 1 we have P(A ∩B) = P(A) + P(B) −P(A ∪B). Since P(A ∩B) ≥0, we have P(A ∪B) ≤P(A) + P(B). Let us now provide an interesting example of how to use the classical definition. This is famous among the probabilists as the Birthday problem. We shall now discuss it through the following example. 5 Example 5 We have the following question. Let there be N people on a part. What is the probability that at least two of them have the same birthday?. Let us ignore the leap years for the moment and see what we get. This problem is solved by first computing the probability of the complementary event, i.e. no two people have their birthdays in the same year. Let Ac denote that event. Of course in this case we easily observe that the sample space of this problem has 365N. Then we note that to find the number of elementary events which are favorable to the event Ac let us think in the following way. Among N persons choose any one person. Then he/she has 365 possible days for a birthday. From the remaining N −1 persons choose another one. This person must have only 364 possible days for a birthday by the very construction of the event Ac. We continue in this manner until we have exhausted all the N persons in the party. Thus P(AC) = 365 · 364 · 363 · · · · (365 −(N −1)) 365N . Thus it is natural to denote the event that at least two people have the same birthday as A and we can compute P(A) as follows P(A) = 1 −365 · 364 · 363 · · · · (365 −(N −1)) 365N . We shall establish below that if we want to have the P(A) ≥0.5, then we must have N ≥23 under some mild approximations. In fact if we want P(A) = 0.5 then we can show the approximately N should be 23. It means that it is ”highly likely” that if you ask each in a group of twenty three people their respective birthdays you will find that at least two people will have the same birthday. We have done this experiment in the class several times and each time we found at least two students with the same birthday and several times it also happened that we found more than a pair of students with the same birthday. Observe that we can write the probability of Ac as P(Ac) = (1 − 1 365)(1 − 2 365) · · · (1 −N −1 365 ). Now for the sake of convenience, let us replace 365 with the letter k and then the above product will be (1 −1 k )(1 −2 k ) · · · (1 −N −1 k ) = N−1 Y j=1 (1 −j k ). We shall use the fact that if j is much less than k, then we can approximate e−j k can be approximated by 1 −j k. If we assume N to be much less compared to 365 then it will be a good approximation to the product we are considering.\n"

      "['Lecture 1 : Random Experiments and Probability Joydeep Dutta, Aditya Medury and Aditya Vikram August 2024 1 Introduction There are a lot of happenings around us about which we cannot make any precise prediction. For example the weather, the outcome of a coin toss, the price of a stock, the roll of a die, etc. In an informal way we call such an occurence as a random occurence. Thus outcome of such occurences or event are uncertain. Probability theory concerns itself with the computation of the ”chance” of occurence of a random event. In order to develop a formal theory of chance or probability we look at more controlled experiments whose outcome are uncertain. Two such important examples are tossing a fair coin and the rolling of a fair die. Beware of the word fair. In this word lies a key idea of probability. For example by a fair coin we mean a coin which is manufactured in such a way that both head and tail have an ”equal chance” of occurence. The phrase ”equal chance” will be play a crucial role in building the first intutive by very fruitful working definition of probability. Such controlled experiments are often called random experiments. Usually the outcome of random experiments are called random events. However the outcome of any uncertain event is usually called a random event whether they are controlled experiments or not. The best things about random experiments is that we known in most cases all the possible outcomes. Each outcome of a random experiment is called an elementary event and usuall denoted by ω. The set of all elementary events is called the sample space and is known as Ω. Example 1 If we toss a coin we are not sure in which way it will turn up when it hits the ground. One may say apart from the outcome resulting in a head or tail one may argue that on a cricket field for example the coin may get stuck in the soil and remain vertical or slightly slanted and not flat. However in order to build a formal theory of probability theory we need to make a more idealistic assumption. In fact in ths case we shall go by Galelio’s dictum that in science we keep the essential and ignore the inessential. Thus we will assume that a fair coin when tossed will always show either of the faces. We shall say the elementary event of the occurence of head will be denoted by ω1 and that of tail as ω2. Thus we can write ω1 = H = Head and ω2 = T = Tail. Thus we have 1 the sample space is given as Ω= {ω1, ω2} = {H, T}. The description of the sample space and the elementary events completely de- scribe the random experiment which will result into such outcomes. □ Example 2 Let us consider another very prototypical random experiment which plays a major role in building examples in probability theory. This random ex- periment involves the rolling of a ” fair ” die. Please keep an eye on the term fair here. In this very term lies the key through the basic model of probability is built. One can easily see that if we roll a die there are six possible out come. The face which is upward that is facing us mist show us either 1 , 2, 3, 4 , 5 or 6 dots that are usually drawn on the die. The reader should imagine playing ludo and the excitement we had when the face with the six dots turning up two consecutive times which allows us to start the game. We will soon see how tactfully this game is devised. So by the term ” fair ” we mean that each of the six numbers have ”equal chance” of appearing. A very logical and rigorous reader may immediately dismiss this kind of thinking that we are subtly having an idea of what probability or chance easy even before defining it. However that was the way the subject was actually built. However to remain faithful to the notational format in the case of rolling a fair die the sample space can be written as Ω= {ω1, . . . , ω6} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. A careful reader must have already thought that whatever has been discussed here can be applied to the tossing of a coin and we should also call by the same reasoning the coin to be a ” fair coin”. This subtle idea actually allows us to build models in probability theory and also develop some key ideas in statistics. We shall discuss all these in detail as we progress. □ In the next example we shall look into a more complicated random experiment involving coins and dice but using more than one of them Example 3 Let us first consider two coins together. This means two experi- menters are involved if we want the coins to be tossed at the same time. Of course the same experimenter can toss the coin simulatenously and we will say a trail is conducted when coin is tossed twice. Naturally there are four outcomes and we can write the sample space as Ω= {HH, HT, TH, TT} Further for rolling two dice consecutively for each of the six possible out comes on the first die, there are six possible outcomes in the second die. Thus there are thirty six possible outcomes. We can in this case write the sample space as Ω= {(ω1, ω2) : ωi ∈{1, 2, . . . , 6}, i = 1, 2} 2 In fact if we toss a coin n times there will be 2n possible outcomes and if a die is rolled n times then there are 6n possible outcomes. This nice pattern makes the coin and the die, the fair ones of course as the prototypical model for studying probability theory. In these examples there is subtle use of the idea of ”independence” a notion which will be important to probability theory and we will study this idea in Lecture 3. □ 2 Events and Classical Probability To be precise, for a finite sample space Ω, we can define any subset of Ωas an event. Thus the power set of the sample space Ωwhich is often denoted as 2Ωis called the set of all events associated with the random experiment. We would again like to recall that the outcome of a trial of a random experiment is called a random event, which is usually denoted by ω and is a member of the sample space Ω. If ω ∈A ⊂Ω, then we say that the event A has occurred. For example let us consider the random experiment of a rolling a fair die again. We say that the event A is said to occur if an odd number turns up. Thus we say the event A has occurred if the face of the die shows 1, 3 or 5. Thus, A = {1, 3, 5}, which is a subset of the sample space Ω−{1, 2, , 4, 5}. We say that events A and B are mutually exclusive if A ∩B = ∅. In addition, we say that events A1, A2, . . . , Ak are mutually exclusive pairs or just mutually exclusive if Ai ∩Aj = ∅for any i ̸= j with i, j = 1, 2, . . . , k. The empty set or ∅ is said to denote a null event or in a very crude way an event which has a zero ”chance” of occurrence. Let us consider a random experiment that results in N outcomes. Thus the sample space is given as Ω= {ω1, ω2, . . . , ωN}. Note that {ω1}, . . . { ωN} form a set of mutually exclusive events. For example if we toss a fair coin either head or tail appears but not both. Also one has an intuitive feel that both have equal ” chance of occurence”. We say that head and tail are equally likely events. Further the elementary events {ω1}, . . . { ωN} are called exhaustive events as nothing beyond these are possible. This will lead to the classical definition of probability. In what follows we shall denote the cardinality of an event A as card(A). Let a random experiment result into N mutually exclusive, exhaustive and ”equally like” events. Let A be an event with card(A) = nA, i.e. the num- ber of elementary events favorable to the event A is nA. Then the probability of the occurence of the event A is given as P(A) = nA N . A point of contention in this definition is the use of the term ”equally likely”. It almost means that we have used an intuitive understanding of probability to define the probability of an event. In other words it means that we somehow have an idea of the probability of the elementary events and use that idea to 3 define the probability of general events which consists of several elementary events themselves.']\n"
